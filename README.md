- Repo to install in order to load data automatically: https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data
    - details on how to setup your session cookies can be found here: https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1
    - Note: in order to extract the session cookie needed to load data directly to Python, one needs to be logged in to the 2019 problems specifically. The cookies vary per year.
    - Once you have the cookie session, load it by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```export AOC_SESSION=53616c7465645f5fe08cace8544b22a62135e34d0628b881c7b7ceafe58f1da3c202b751699f3d147ac851d8a523d6a```
    - Note: if you add an eight to the end of the cookie above you will be able to run using Ignacio's key, but you won't be able to use the results to update your own session.
